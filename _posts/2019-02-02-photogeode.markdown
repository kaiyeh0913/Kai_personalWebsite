We create an icosahedron multi-view capture enviroment for photorealistic human facial geometry and appearance modeling. We had took our project to showcase at 2019 Adobe Tech summit at San Francisco which we had captured nearly 500 faces on scene and created a high quality 3D and appearance human facial dataset.
